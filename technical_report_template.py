    Cancer diagnosis represents one of the most critical applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare. 
    Traditional machine learning approaches often rely on static feature selection and single-model predictions, 
    limiting their adaptability and explainability. This project implements a novel multi-agent reinforcement 
    learning system based on the Dayhoff framework, specifically designed for cancer genomics analysis.
    
    The system addresses three key challenges: (1) optimal feature selection from high-dimensional genomic data, 
    (2) adaptive diagnosis decision-making, and (3) coordinated learning between specialized agents. By combining 
    Deep Q-Networks for feature selection with Policy Gradients for diagnosis, our approach learns to optimize 
    both feature efficiency and diagnostic accuracy simultaneously.

    The Dayhoff Framework consists of three main components:
    
    <b>Feature Analysis Agent (DQN):</b> Implements Deep Q-Network to learn optimal feature selection strategies. 
    The agent observes genomic feature vectors and selects the most informative subset for diagnosis, balancing 
    accuracy with computational efficiency.
    
    <b>Diagnosis Agent (Policy Gradients):</b> Uses REINFORCE algorithm to learn diagnosis policies. Given selected 
    features, the agent outputs probability distributions over diagnosis classes (malignant vs. benign), learning 
    to maximize diagnostic accuracy through direct policy optimization.
    
    <b>Coordination Agent:</b> Orchestrates interaction between the two specialized agents, managing reward sharing 
    and communication protocols. Ensures system-wide optimization rather than local agent optimization.

    <b>3.1 DQN Formulation for Feature Selection:</b>
    
    The feature selection problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process where:
    - State s_t: Current genomic feature vector
    - Action a_t: Selected feature subset indices  
    - Reward r_t: Accuracy improvement + efficiency bonus
    - Q-function: Q(s,a) estimates expected future reward for selecting features a in state s
    
    The DQN loss function minimizes the temporal difference error:
    L(θ) = E[(r + γ max_a' Q(s', a'; θ⁻) - Q(s, a; θ))²]
    
    <b>3.2 Policy Gradient Formulation for Diagnosis:</b>
    
    The diagnosis agent optimizes policy π_θ(a|s) using REINFORCE:
    ∇_θ J(θ) = E[∇_θ log π_θ(a|s) * (R_t - b(s))]
    
    Where R_t is the discounted return and b(s) is a learned baseline.
    
    <b>3.3 Reward Function Design:</b>
    
    R_total = R_accuracy + R_efficiency + R_coordination
